> Q13. Determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes

A/A
```{r}
Aonly<- sum(data$geno == "A/A")
Aonly
```

A/G
```{r}
mixed<- sum(data$geno == "A/G")
mixed
```

G/G
```{r}
Gonly <-sum(data$geno == "G/G")
Gonly
```

```{r}


Aonly.mean <- rowSums(Aonly)/ ncol(Aonly)
head(Aonly.mean)
```








> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?
